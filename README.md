# WEBFISHING MML player

This program accepts MML texts as input and simply plays it via in-game guitar. It clicks instead of you and 
presses buttons instead of you. Program **does not require to install any additional stuff** it works as is. 
(if you have .NET framework installed of course, if not, it will send you to Microsoft's website so you can download it)  
It has **28 built-in songs** to play.
But, of course, you may play what you want (if you know what MML is).  
It can play maximum MML 2 tracks at the same time. Program works good if player count not exceeds 5-6.  
Also, due to it emulates user input, it is FPS dependent. (below 60 it start to miss notes, you may simply look at floor, 
moving camera closer to character)  

Program require **calibration** in order to operate. Jusck click "Calibration" button and click every note on guitar, one by one (shown in video)  
After calibration software is ready to operate.  

"*" (Num_Multiply) button stops the current track.  
"Home" button closes the program.
